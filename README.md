My Final Year Project
The purpose of this project is to develop a music browsing tool for Discogs.

# Project Description #
This project will look at creating a better browsing interface for Discogs using its API. Currently searches return long lists that are difficult to read through. They are completly removed from the traditoinal browsing experience of a record shop. This propject will require skills in ther javascript libraires to reproduce this experience.
